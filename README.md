Wordpress (Pantheon) + Gatsby powered statically generated site.

## Folder Setup (Recommended)

This repo includes a `gatsby/` folder with the front-end source files.

If the backend code needs to be updated. Clone it from pantheon into this folder (just to keep both parts of the site together). The folders `cms/` and `wordpress/` are gitignored if you want to use those. You can still use `lando` in the subfolder as well to use a local copy of Wordpress as the source during dev.
