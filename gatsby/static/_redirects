# enter the old URL, then some whitespace, then the new URL
#    optionally, add whitespace + HTTP code at the end to redirect with a certain code (301 is default, 200 will do a pass-through, 404 for custom Not Found page)
# trailing slashes are ignored, don't use this file to trim them (unless you want an infinite redirect loop). Netlify's dashboard has a setting for pretty URLs
